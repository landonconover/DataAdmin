My name is Landon Conover, and I currently work for Utah Valley University as a Systems Administrator in the Business Intelligence department.

I have worked for UVU for almost 12 years. I started in a department called [Automation and Integration Services (AIS)](https://uvu.edu/ais/) for about five years. During that time, I became the 'report' guy. Anytime a product that the department was writing needed some report or graph, I would be the one to implement that feature. So when the Sys Admin had a position open that was to be the sysadmin over the Reporting Environment for UVU, it made sense for me to apply.

During my last six years at UVU, I have used my web development background to improve my sysadmin skills and data delivery with BI.

Recently our (relatively) new CIO and VP of Digital Transformationation at UVU, [Kelly Flanagan](https://kelly.flanagan.io/), has encouraged us to start blogging as a way to keep track of what we do and share it with the community as a form of documentation. I am taking him up on this as a way for me personally to understand my work better and to internalize it better.
