# Welcome to DataAdmin.dev!

My name is Landon Conover, I currently work for Utah Valley University as a Systems Administrator in the Business Intellegence department.

I have worked for UVU for almost 12 years. I started off in a departement called [Automation and Integration Services (AIS)](https://uvu.edu/ais/) for about 5 years. During that time, I became the 'report' guy. Anytime a product that the department was writing needed some kind of report or graph, I would be the one to implament that feature. So when the Sys Admin had a postion open that was to be the sys admin over the Reporting Enviorment for UVU it made since for me to apply.
